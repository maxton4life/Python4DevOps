# Day 0 🛩️
On day 0, I look at the basics of the Python programming language. These includes : 👇

  ### General basic syntax
  - **Variables**
  - **Data Types**
  - **Operators**

At the end of this phase, I should be familiar, and also be able to understand these concepts of the Python Programming. 😃 👋
