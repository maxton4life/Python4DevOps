# Python4DevOps
---

This repository contains my personal learning on python exclusively for devops. 

**Why Python?** 
I am using python to learn devops practices because it's the most widely used   language to 

automate tasks that are repeatable.

I used chat gpt to make a roadmap on python for DevOps ðŸ‘‰ [chatgpt](https://www.chat.openai.com). 

I will be covering all these ðŸ‘‡ to have a good grasps of the python programming language for devops 

 Here's a roadmap outlining the key steps to learn Python for a DevOps role:

### 1. Basics of Python
   - Learn about variables, data types, operators, and basic syntax.
   - Understand control structures like loops and conditional statements.
   - Familiarize yourself with functions and their usage.

### 2. File Handling and Data Manipulation
   - Learn how to read from and write to files.
   - Explore working with JSON, CSV, and other data formats.
   - Understand regular expressions for text manipulation.

### 3. Version Control with Git
   - Learn the fundamentals of version control using Git.
   - Understand branching, merging, and resolving conflicts.
   - Explore using Git in collaboration with teams.

### 4. Scripting and Automation
   - Create Python scripts for automating repetitive tasks.
   - Explore libraries like `os`, `shutil`, and `subprocess` for system interactions.
   - Learn about scheduling tasks using `cron` or `at` on Linux.

### 5. Networking and Web Services
   - Learn about sockets and networking concepts.
   - Explore making HTTP requests using libraries like `requests`.
   - Understand how to work with APIs and parse JSON responses.

### 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
   - Learn about IaC concepts and benefits.
   - Use Python to write infrastructure scripts using libraries like `boto3` (for AWS) or `azure-mgmt` (for Azure).

### 7. Configuration Management
   - Understand the basics of configuration management tools like Ansible.
   - Learn how to write Ansible playbooks in Python.

### 8. Containerization and Orchestration
   - Learn Docker basics: containers, images, volumes.
   - Explore Kubernetes concepts and use the Kubernetes Python client.

### 9. Cloud Services
   - Explore cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP.
   - Use Python SDKs (`boto3`, `azure-mgmt`, etc.) to interact with cloud services.

### 10. Monitoring and Logging
    - Learn about monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
    - Explore logging libraries like logging in Python.

### 11. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
    - Learn about CI/CD concepts and tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Travis CI.
    - Explore using Python scripts in your CI/CD pipelines.

### 12. Security and Automation
    - Understand security best practices for DevOps.
    - Use Python to automate security checks and tasks.

### 13. Learning from Real-World Projects
    - Work on projects that involve automating deployment, scaling, and maintenance.
    - Practice integrating different DevOps tools with Python scripts.
